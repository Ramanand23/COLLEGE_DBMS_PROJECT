# College-DBMS-project
# College Database Management System

This project implements a simple College Database Management System using PostgreSQL. It includes SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and performing various queries.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following SQL script files:

1. **ddl.sql**: Contains Data Definition Language (DDL) commands for creating tables.
2. **dml.sql**: Contains Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands for inserting data into the tables.
3. **queries.sql**: Contains various SQL queries for retrieving and manipulating data.

## Tables

The database consists of the following tables:

- `STUDENT`: Stores details of students.
- `SEMSEC`: Stores information about semesters and sections.
- `CLASS`: Stores information about which student is in which class.
- `SUBJECT`: Stores details about subjects.
- `IAMARKS`: Stores internal assessment marks of students.

## SQL Scripts

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

The `ddl.sql` file contains SQL commands to create the tables

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

The `dml.sql` file contains SQL commands to insert/update/delete data into the tables

### DQL (Data Query Language)

The `queries.sql` file contains SQL commands to fetch the data from the tables

How to Run ?

1. Install PostgreSQL: Make sure PostgreSQL is installed on your system.
2. Create Database: Create a new database in PostgreSQL.
3. Execute DDL Script: Run the ddl.sql script to create the tables.
4. Execute DML Script: Run the dml.sql script to insert data into the tables.
5. Execute Queries: Run the queries.sql script to perform various queries.
